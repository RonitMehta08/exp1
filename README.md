Experiment 1: Introduction to Python
Aim:
To understand the basics of Python programming and write simple programs using variables, data types, operators, input/output statements, mathematical functions, and conditional statements.

Theory:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and user-friendly programming language widely used for beginners as well as professionals. This experiment introduces fundamental Python concepts through multiple small programs. Each code cell demonstrates a specific concept, explained below:

**Cell 1: Variable Assignment and Printing**

    In this cell, multiple variables (x, y, z) are assigned string values in a single line. The print() function is used to display multiple variables at once as well as an individual variable. This demonstrates:
    Multiple variable assignment
    Use of the print() function
    Basic string handling in Python

**Cell 2: Data Types in Python**

Here, variables of different data types are created:

int (integer)

float (decimal number)

str (string)

bool (boolean value)

The type() function is used to identify and display the data type of each variable. This helps in understanding Python’s dynamic typing system, where the data type is assigned automatically based on the value.

**Cell 3: Arithmetic Operations**

Two numeric variables are defined and basic arithmetic operations are performed:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Exponentiation

This cell demonstrates Python’s arithmetic operators and how mathematical expressions are evaluated and displayed using print().

**Cell 4: Arithmetic Operations with User Input**

This cell is similar to the previous one, but values are taken from the user using the input() function. The inputs are converted to integers using int() to allow mathematical operations. This introduces:

User interaction

Type conversion

Dynamic input handling

**Cell 5: Area of a Circle (Using Formula)**

The radius of a circle is taken as user input and converted into a float. The area is calculated using the formula:

Area=3.14×r
2

This cell demonstrates:

Mathematical formulas in Python

Use of float values

Practical application of arithmetic operations
**
Cell 6: Using Math Module**

The math module is imported to access predefined mathematical functions. The value of π (math.pi) is used for more accurate area calculation, and math.log10() is used to calculate the logarithm of the radius. This introduces:

Importing libraries

Built-in mathematical functions

More precise computations

**Cell 7: Logarithmic Functions**

This cell calculates:

Area of a circle using math.pi

Base-10 logarithm of the radius using math.log10()

It highlights Python’s capability to handle advanced mathematical operations efficiently.

**Cell 8: Conditional Statements**

Two variables are compared using an if-else statement. Based on the condition, an appropriate message is printed. This demonstrates:

Decision-making in Python

Use of relational operators

Control flow using if-else

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Assign values to variables and display them using the print() function.
3. Declare variables of different data types and identify their types using type().
4. Perform arithmetic operations on predefined values.
5. Accept user input and perform arithmetic calculations.
6. Calculate the area of a circle using a fixed value of π.
7. Import the math module and use built-in mathematical functions.
8. Implement conditional statements to compare values.
9. Display all results.
10. Stop the program.

Conclusion:
In this experiment, the fundamentals of Python programming were successfully studied and implemented. Concepts such as variable declaration, data types, arithmetic operations, user input, mathematical functions, and conditional statements were clearly understood through practical examples. This experiment builds a strong foundation for advanced Python programming and problem-solving.
