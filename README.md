#**EXPERIMENT 1 : INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON**

##*AIM*: **To understand the Basics of Python Programming and write simple programs**

*THEORY*:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability, enabling programmers to write clear and logical code for both small and large applications. It supports various built-in data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans for efficient data storage and manipulation, and the type() function is used to identify the data type of a variable. Python allows multiple assignment, where values can be assigned to multiple variables in a single statement. Arithmetic operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**) are used to perform mathematical calculations. The input() function is used to accept user input, which is then typecast into required data types such as int() or float(). Python also provides the built-in math module that includes mathematical constants and functions like math.pi and math.log10() for advanced calculations. Conditional statements using if and else are used for decision-making by comparing values and executing appropriate code blocks based on specified conditions.
*ALGORITHM*:

*Program 1: Variable Declaration and Printing*
        
        start
        Declare string variables and assign values to them.
        Assign multiple values to multiple variables using a single statement.
        Display the values of variables using the print() function with appropriate separators.
        stop

*Program 2: Data Types*

        start
        Declare variables of different data types such as integer, float, string, and boolean.
        Use the type() function to identify and display the data type of each variable.
        stop

*Program 3: Mathematical Operations*

           start
           Declare numeric variables.
           Perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, and exponentiation.
           Store the results in variables and display the output.
           stop

*Program 4: User Input and Arithmetic Operations*

           start
           Accept two integer values from the user using the input() function.
           Convert the input values into integers.
           Display the entered values.
           Perform arithmetic operations on the user-provided inputs.
           Display the results.
           stop

*Program 5: Area of a Circle*

           start
           Import the math module.
           Accept the radius of the circle from the user.
           Calculate the area using the formula:
           Area = π × r²
           Display the calculated area of the circle.
           stop

*Program 6: Logarithmic Calculation*

            start
            Import the math module.
            Accept a number from the user.
            Calculate the base-10 logarithm of the number using math.log10().
            Display the logarithmic value.
            stop

*Program 7: Comparison Using Conditional Statements*

            start
            Accept two numbers from the user.
            Compare the two numbers using an if-else statement.
            Display which number is greater or if both numbers are equal.
            stop

*CONCLUSION:*

        This experiment successfully introduced the fundamental concepts of Python programming. Through this experiment, the use of variables, data types, arithmetic operations, user input handling, mathematical          functions, and conditional statements was understood and implemented effectively. The practical implementation of these concepts provided a strong foundation in Python programming and enhanced logical             thinking skills, which are essential for developing more complex programs in future applications.
